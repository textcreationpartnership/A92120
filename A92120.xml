            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

early, our Horſe and Dragoons poſſeſſed the Iſland and Fort, and ſo hath prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Enemies flight by Sea; and by Land their body cannot ſtir: ſome Horſe may perchance in
the night
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161831:3"/>eſcape, and leave the reſt to ſlaughter. For,
ſuch is the rage of the Soldier for the loſs of their Commanders, that they vvill hardly admit
of quarter. Many honeſt people (though the meaner ſort) ſteal out of town hourly to us; and
all agree in one ſtory, That the Enemy knows not which way to turn himſelf, that he is
deſparate, and thinks to get Conditions for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by their having Sir <hi>William
Maſham,</hi> and others of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee priſoners. The General ſent a Trumpeter to ſee
Sir <hi>William Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi> but they yet detain the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter. The Townſmen ſay, they had
ſix hundred men run away that night the fight was; we have Five hundred priſoners, moſt taken
from the Gates of the City: The Enemy buried of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161831:3"/>their ſlain men, Sixty in one Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
beſides what was ſlain in the other part of the Town; they ſay, that Sir <hi>William
Campion,</hi> and one Knight more, Col: <hi>Cook</hi> and two Majors, and other Officers were
ſlain; ſome priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners we have taken ſince confeſs as much, and many of quality wounded;
many of the priſoners of the Trained bands, (which this day the General releaſed, being ſore
wounded) ſay, That they vvent under Col: <hi>Farre</hi> my Lord <hi>Warwicks</hi> Lieutenant
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, that he lead them out into the field, and into Mr. <hi>Grimſtons</hi> houſe; and when
he and the men fled, being galled with our Musketiers, he got to the gate, and cauſed it to be
ſhut, and left his men to be cut in pieces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wall, if our Soldiers had not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161831:4"/>been more merciful. The General is cloſe
beleaguering the Town; this day Col: <hi>Ewers</hi> is come up with his Regiment, and all our
Train: The General purpoſes to preſerve the town from plunder and fire, if it be poſſible;
though one <hi>Buxton,</hi> and the <hi>Leomons,</hi> and many more (as thoſe that come out
inform) encourages <hi>Goring</hi> and the Cavaliers to hold out: Many an honeſt body is undone
by them; God is onely wiſe: for who could have found out ſuch a way to unite the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
party together againſt this bloody and common Enemy? There are Four Colonels taken at
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> about to raiſe men for the King, Col: ſir <hi>Bar Scudamore</hi> is one of
